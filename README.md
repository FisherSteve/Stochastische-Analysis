# Stochastische-Analysis: Applied Financial Mathematics

This repository serves as a practical collection of applications in **financial mathematics**, primarily based on concepts and methods learned during my studies in mathematics. It aims to bridge theoretical stochastic analysis with real-world financial problems.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to showcase various implementations and analyses related to financial instruments, models, and derivatives pricing using mathematical and computational techniques. You'll find code examples and analyses that demonstrate the application of stochastic calculus, probability theory, and numerical methods in finance.

## Contents

* **`financial_toolkit/`**: A module or collection of scripts containing reusable functions and classes for financial calculations, such as option pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes), Monte Carlo simulations, and risk measures.
* **`test.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating specific financial applications, model testing, and data analysis. These notebooks serve as interactive examples to understand the implementations.
* **`grafiken/`**: Placeholder for any graphical outputs or visualizations generated from the analyses.

## Technologies & Libraries

* **Python**: The primary programming language used.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development, analysis, and visualization.
* **NumPy / SciPy**: For numerical operations and scientific computing.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Getting Started

To explore the content of this repository, you'll need to have Python and the listed libraries installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/FisherSteve/Stochastische-Analysis.git](https://github.com/FisherSteve/Stochastische-Analysis.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Stochastische-Analysis
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries (if you don't have them):**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a browser window where you can navigate to and run the `.ipynb` files.
